# Java notes
- Classes have 4 levels, public(any class), private(only in the class declared), protected(any class in same package or subclasses anywhere), default(absence of a modifer, any class or subclass in same package but only accesible in that package)
- Java can only extend one other class, inheritance defines an is-a type of relationship, inheritance brings in public & protected methods of its parent and allows method overwriting
- polymorphism
-  super gives a reference to the parent, the same way this reference returns itself
-  static defines shared memembers across all classes can be used without instancing first
- final makes something immutable
- abstract is an incomplete method, and can only be extended and not instantiated
